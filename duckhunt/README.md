Assignment 2: Duck Hunt
=======================

Date: 2/25/14

Purpose: Make use of javascript to draw images on a webpage using canvas. The images are "sliced" on a spritesheet in a directory called duckhunt. A draw() function, written on the game.js file, handles the slicing.

1. Aspects that have been correctly implemented:
-The draw method effectively displays the images on the webpage which include: the sky, the dirt, the bushes, a tree, the dog sniffing the ground, and a total of 5 birds. 
What didn't work:
-Although the assignment requires all the work to be done on the game.js file, it was necessary to edit the index.html file. The event "onload=draw();" was added to allow the game.js file to interact with the html page. 

2. Discussed the assignment with: Lisa Fan

3. Amount of time spent working on assignment: ~3 hrs
