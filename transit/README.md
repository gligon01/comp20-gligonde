=========================================

1 - Program Performance

A) Aspects that have been correctly implemented:
-Google Map of given MBTA subway line renders successfully
-Custom icons (which are simply small sections of png files) were used to 
to mark stations on the Red, Orange, and Blue lines
-A colored polyline (based on subway line) connects all of the stations of 
associated with the color of the polyline
-User location successfully retrieved via JavaScript navigator.geolocation object
-User location is displayed on the map with marker and info window
-Furthermore, the distance between the user and the nearest subway station
(in miles) is shown in the info window of the user's current location marker
-Upon clicking  on a station icon on the map, an info window pops up giving
the name of the station, and a table containing subway arrival schedule, 
destination direction, for each station on the line.
-In the event that the MBTA schedule cannot be processed (500 status), an
alert window pops up informing the user that data could not be retrieved
