1. OMFGDOGS: Lab 4. There are four files in the folder which are: index.html, omfgdogs.css, omfgdogs.gif, omfgdogs.mp3. The main purpose of the lab was to set up a webpage that displayed a gif image and a looped a sound clip. If the size of the screen were to be lower than 992px, the message "No OMFGDOGS for you!" would be displayed. A link to the original webpage added at the bottom right of the index page.

2. status_updates: Lab 5. There is only one file in the folder. The main purpose of the lab was to dynamically change the content of a webpage. After the user inputs a message in a text box, it is displayed under the "Updates" section of the webpage along with the time and date at which the message was submitted. Lab must be completed using only Javascript.
